**gogeoip2** is a Go-based IP lookup tool which provides geographic metadata for an IPv4 address in it's simplest form. It can _also_ be extended (with a [premium database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-isp-database)) to provide ISP information (i.e. ASN and ISP name)


This data allows one to make informed decisions about who owns IP addresses/network blocks. This tool was used at [HotelTonight](https://www.hoteltonight.com) to make decisions about automatically blocking traffic using a scoring algorithm based on network reputation.

A demo service is currently hosted (and rate-limitted) at http://geo.srv.im â€” hosted on Docker by [Hyper](https://www.hyper.sh)!
